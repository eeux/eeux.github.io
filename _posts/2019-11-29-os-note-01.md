Everyday we use computer to do our work. Do you think these questions before:
- what is computer operating system?
- what does the role it play?
- ...





#### What is computer operating system?
##### Extension for machine
- under windows environment, user can use computer easily
- user uses the file access command for file access
- user uses I/O commands to input and output data
- ...

##### Resource Manager

> what if 3 programs try to print result of computing **simultaneously**?

OS's important task: **orderly** control the allocation of equipment among competing programs.

- processor's allocation & control
- memory allocation & free
- allocation & free for I/O devices
- file access, sharing and protection

implementation of it:
- `Time reuse`: time-sharing of CPU
- `Spacial reuse`: simultaneously sharing of space

##### conclusion
- for **computer system**, the operating system is a collection of programs which manage all system resources
- for **user**, the operating system provides a simple and abstract way to effectively use system resources

#### History
##### 1. no operating system
  - cons
      - the user owns the entire machine, and the resource utilization is low
      - CPU waits for manual operation
  - solution
      - set up a `operator` to reduce operational errors
      - `batching` -- realize automatic transition of jobs

##### 2. single-pass batch system
features: 
- always keep only one program in memory

![single-pass-programming](https://github.com/eeux/blog-pictures/blob/master/2019/11/single-pass--programming.png?raw=true)

props:
- reduces CPU `idle time`
- speeds up I/O

cons:
- uneven use of CPU and I/O (depends on features of current job)
- for `calculation-oriented` job, `peripheral` is idle
- for `I/O-oriented` job, CPU is idle

**So how to keep both CPU and peripheral busy?**

##### 3. multiprogramming batch system
features:
- keeps multiple grogram in memory
- **overlaps** user's CPU request and I/O request
- `parallel` in macro view
  - programs in system are **running**, but haven't finished
- `serial` in micro view
  - jobs use the CPU and execute **alternately**

props:
- high resource utilization
- large system throughout

cons:
- long average job turnaround time
- no interaction

##### 5. Time-Sharing System
- `multiprogramming batch system`: level up resource utilization and system throughout
- `time-sharing system`: meets user needs, such as good human-machine interaction

the **most critical** problem is that
system should receive and process commands input by user **in time**, and then return the result to user.

and the **main idea** of it is:
- divide the processor time into very short `time slices`, and distribute these time slices to each online job in turn
- if a job is not completed when the time slice assigned to it is used up, the job is temporarily interrupted, waiting for the next run, and giving control of the processor to another job
- in a relatively short time interval, each user's job can be quickly responded for `human-computer interaction`

its **features**:
- `multipath`
  - allows multiple hosts to connect to one host at the same time, and the system serves each user ona time-sharing basis
- `independence`
  - every user operates independently without disturbance
- `timeliness`
  - user's request can be responded in short time
- `interactivity`

##### 6. Real-Time System
Processing transactions **must** be completed within a specific **time limit** applicable to this system.

we can classify task by **deadline**:
- `hard-real-time` task
- `soft real-time` task

it can be applied in:
- real-time control system
  - computer-centric production process control system
- real-time information processing system
  - *aircraft booking system*, *information retrieval system*, ...

its **features** are:
- multipath & independent
- timely response
- high reliability & safety
- easy interactivity

##### direction of OS development
- macro view: distributed OS, cluster OS, WebOs, Cloud OS
- micro view: embedded OS

#### Main Concepts
- process
- address space
- file
- input/output (I/O)
- protection
- shell

##### reuse of concept
Changes in technology can cause some ideas to become **obsolete** and quickly disappear.
But another change in technology may also **revive** some ideas.

##### System call
There are 2 states in computer system:
- kernel state
  - a state where os kernel programs execute
  - can execute any instruction
  - has access to all resisters and storage area
- user state
  - a state where user programs execute
  - can only execute **specified** instructions
  - can only access **specified** registers and storage area

In Linux, there are `kernel space` and `user space`, which runs at different level, isolated with each other logically. In general, user processes can neither access to kernel data, nor use kernel function. **How user process get required system services?**

![system call](https://github.com/eeux/blog-pictures/blob/master/2019/11/system-call.png?raw=true)

Let's see the **definition** together:

`System call` is a group of special interface provided by operating system.

User programs can obtain services provided by the operating system kernel through this `special set of interfaces` (open/close/read/write files, get system time, ...).

The particularity of the system call mainly lies in the **specific location** where the user process the kernel. In other words, the path for users to access the kernel is specified in advance. User can't skip into kernel randomly.

#### OS Structure
- Monolithic structure
- Hierarchical structure
- Virtual machine structure
- C/S structure (micro kernel structure)
