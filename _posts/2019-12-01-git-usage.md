Git is an awesome version control system.
This passage will introduce basic usage of it...




#### Start Up
##### Introduction to Git commits
```sh
$ git commit -m <msg>
```

##### Branching in Git
```sh
$ git branch <branch-name>
$ git checkout <branch-name>
or you can use
$ git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

##### Merging in Git
merge branch `bugFix` to branch `master`
```sh
$ git merge bugFix
```

##### Rebase Introduction
The second way of combining work between branches is rebasing. The advantage of rebasing is that it can be used to make a nice **linear sequence** of commits.
```sh
$ git rebase master
$ git checkout master
$ git rebase bugFix
```

#### Ramping Up
##### 1. Detach your HEAD
`HEAD` is the symbolic name for the currently checked out commit -- it's essentially what commit you're working on top of.

`Detaching HEAD` just means attaching it to a `commit` instead of a `branch`. This is what it looks like beforehand:
```sh
$ git checkout C1
```

##### 2. Relative Refs
- Moving upwards one commit at a time with `^`
    ```sh
    $ git checkout C3
    $ git checkout HEAD^
    $ git checkout HEAD^
    $ git checkout HEAD^
    ```
    ![git-relative-refs^](https://github.com/eeux/blog-pictures/blob/master/2019/12/git-relative-refs.gif?raw=true)

- Moving upwards a number of times with `~<num>`
    ```sh
    $ git branch -f master HEAD~3
    ```
    ![git-relative-refs~](https://github.com/eeux/blog-pictures/blob/master/2019/12/git-relative-refs2.gif?raw=true)

##### 3. Reversing Changes in Git
- `git reset` will move a branch backwards as if the commit had never been made in the first place.
```sh
$ git reset HEAD~1
```
![git-reset](https://github.com/eeux/blog-pictures/blob/master/2019/12/git-reset.gif?raw=true)
- In order to reverse changes and share those reversed changes with others, we need to use `git revert`.
```sh
$ git revert HEAD
```

#### Moving Work Around
##### Cherry-pick Intro
We can copy commits in other branch easily:
```sh
$ git cherry-pick <Commit1> <Commit2> <...>
```

##### Interactive Rebase Intro
Git cherry-pick is great when you know which commits you want.
But what about the situation where **you don't know what commits you want**? 
Thankfully, we can use **interactive** rebasing for this -- it's the best way to review a series of commits you're about to rebase.

All interactive rebase means is using the rebase command with the `-i` option.

```sh
$ git rebase -i <source commit>
```

#### A Mixed Bag
A mixed bag of Git techniques, tricks, and tips
##### Grabbing Just 1 Commit
Here's a development situation that often happens:
In order to aid in my bug detective work, I put in a few debug commands and a few print statements.
After I track down the bug, fix it, how can I commit desired parts?

We need to tell git to copy only one of the commits over.
Actually, we can use the commands:
- git rebase -i
- git cherry-pick
To achieve this goal.

```sh
$ git checkout master
$ git cherry-pick bugFix
```

##### Juggling Commits
The tricky thing is that sometimes you need to make a small modification to an earlier commit. 

We will overcome this difficulty by doing the following:

- We will re-order the commits so the one we want to change is on top with `git rebase -i`
- We will `commit --amend` to make the slight modification
- Then we will re-order the commits back to how they were previously with `git rebase -i`
- Finally, we will move master to this updated part of the tree to finish the level (via the method of your choosing)

```sh
$ git rebase -i master
$ git commit -amend
$ git rebase -i master
$ git branch -f master caption
```
